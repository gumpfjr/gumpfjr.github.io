         <h2>My story...</h2>
            <p>My whole life I knew I wanted to do something great I just never really knew what that would entail. As a young kid I found a passion for the arts, starting with painting and drawing. As I grew up I tried many different hobbies and passions like cross-country, track, student government, and more but I always kept returning to the arts. It was until later in life that I realized what a deep passion I had for photography. I did everything I could to learn about the history and techniques of the photography art style. I grew through this passion and it turned into a love of creating things through different mediums like print and web design. I hope to become a skilled web-design guru someday! </p>

        <h3>My Family</h3>
            <p>Growing up I have always had a huge family. I grew up with my two siblings Hannah and Jake and when I got older alot changed. When my parents got divorced they both remarried and this grew the family even more. My dad adopted my two little brothers, Gavin and Caleb, from Ethiopia. My mom remarried my stepdad, Eric, and I gained three new step siblings. I have an even bigger family outside this craziness, but I wouldn't have it any other way because everyday is interesting and filled with inspiration.</p>
